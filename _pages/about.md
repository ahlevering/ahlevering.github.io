I am a research scientist working on modelling, mapping, and studying socio-cultural landscape interactions. I specialize in landscape qualities, such as livability and aesthetic beauty, especially as they are perceived by people. I'm also interested in dataset fairness (e.g. biases and confounders), human-machine interactions, multimodal data fusion approaches, and the interpretability of models. In 2024 I obtained my PhD degree from Wageningen University on the topic of [deep learning for landscape qualities](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/625396). I'm currently an assistant professor of environmental geography at the VU Amsterdam.
