I am a research scientist working on (interpretable) deep learning models for earth observation purposes, with a particular interest in landscape qualities, such as scenicness and liveability. I'm also interested in biases and fairness, human-machine interactions, multimodal data fusion approaches, and data-efficient learning methods. In 2024 I obtained my PhD degree from Wageningen University on the topic of [deep learning for landscape qualities](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/625396). I'm currently working at the VU Amsterdam, where I work on building change detection for cities in the Global South.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
