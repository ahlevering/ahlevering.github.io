Our project on liveability change mapping in Kenya, Nairobi, is in full swing! Our goal is to use AI models to detect changes in liveability from satellite images, with the help of residents and local policy-makers. We performed a repeat measurement of the [data collection campaign](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42949-024-00156-x) performed earlier by co-author Angela Abascal. [We were out with local communities in Kenya](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angela-abascal-imizcoz_citizenscience-ai-earthobservation-activity-7372284769667211264-GE6c?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAA3rrmIBQ15QBXe9kU4vF1vkW-gsYEa63bs) to collect an updated inventory for 2023 so that we can use these to compare them to the dataset of 2019. We will soon have our first results for the project. Stay tuned for more!
