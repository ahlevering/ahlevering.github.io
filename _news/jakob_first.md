We're proud to announce that Jakob Langenbacher's first PhD paper has been [published in Sustainability Science](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396372462_Mapping_megatrends_shaping_European_forests)! European forests are rapidly changing, and their future trajectories are uncertain. Jakob's paper sheds light on major trends that are expected to affect European forests. In his next work he will look into policy optimization for forest management in Europe.
