It has been my pleasure to give a talk about concept-based explanation methods for the _“AI for Remote Sensing and Sustainable Cities Series”_, hosted by HKUST Guangzhou. In this talk I gave a primer on concept-based explanation methods and how they have been used to provide explanations for remote sensing prediction models. [The slides can be found here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mKuCe-jusSNjKZd2MvTo8Lxs7hG4VYQ_/view?usp=sharing), and for any additional questions, feel free to reach out!
