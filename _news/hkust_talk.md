It has been my pleasure to give a talk about concept-based explanation methods for the _“AI for Remote Sensing and Sustainable Cities Series”_, hosted by HKUST Guangzhou. In this talk I gave a primer on concept-based explanation methods and how they have been used to provide explanations for remote sensing prediction models. [The slides can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15jqde0WSp0Tr9EnytnS0xIzczokv-JMz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111757465675197952308&rtpof=true&sd=true), and for any additional questions, feel free to reach out!
