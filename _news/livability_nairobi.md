Together with colleagues from ITC Twente we applied for a VU-UT alliance grant. In the coming year we will perform a repeat measurement of perceived livability in Nairobi, Kenya. By doing so, we will study the rate of change of perceived livability in a highly-dynamic urban environment. Depending on the perceived changes, we will study policy developments to help determine which policies were effective. Ultimately, we want to make AI-ready datasets to help study the development of livability in underserved communities. To be continued.
