I'm delighted to announce that I'm staying at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, now as an assistant professor at the [Environnmental Geography Group](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/research-institutes/institute-for-environmental-studies-ivm/more-about/environmental-geography-eg-ivm)! at the Environmental Geography group! Here, I will continue to perform research and facilitate education on socio-cultural landscape interactions through a combination of GIS, remote sensing, and GeoAI methods. I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to my colleagues and my collaborators. I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to continue working with you!
