It is my great pleasure to announce that I have been appointed as adjunct assistant professor at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology-Guangzhou's Thrust of Urban Governance and Design](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/society-hub/urban-governance-and-design/). This appointment is complimentary to my VU position, and I will support the lab in its early stages of development through guest lectures and collaborations. My sincere thanks go out to [Wufan Zhao](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/ZHAO-Wufan/wufanzhao) for getting me involved in the Thrust!
