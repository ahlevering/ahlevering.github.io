Last month I gave a talk gave a talk for the GeoAI Research Center of the Universiteit Gent. I presented our recently-published work on using volunteer-provided descriptions of landscapes to map landscape scenicness using GeoAI, as well as how this work can contribute to fairer landscape quality assessments. The slides can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I2G2BVAITjLZM8Ilgw1968CEkH5QEaWJI-APQj9bdDM/edit?usp=sharing.
